# Side Notes:
- Credits to [Murtaza Hassan](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYUjYU5FveRAscQ8V21w81A) for 90% of the handy work and the learning process
- This was a passion project, something I made while I was bored. I don't intend on updating this, and there are other alternatives 100x better than this to navigate your computer without any peripherals.
